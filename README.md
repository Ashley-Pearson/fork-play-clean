## Concept:

Couples often struggle to decide where to eat. Both partners swipe through restaurant options in their area. Once both partners swipe right (i.e., approve) on the same restaurant, it’s a match, and they can go dine there! This app could take the frustration out of deciding where to eat by making it a collaborative and fun experience, with the thrill of "matching" adding excitement to date night planning!

## Key Features:

### Dual Swiping:

Each partner has their own profile linked to the couple’s account.
Both partners swipe through restaurant options individually. If they both swipe right on the same restaurant, they get a match, and the app reveals the chosen restaurant.

### Restaurant Profiles:

Each restaurant will have a profile with images, key info (cuisine, price, rating, distance), and reviews.
Restaurant profiles will include features like ambiance (romantic, casual, etc.) and highlight couple-friendly offers like special deals for two.

### Filters and Preferences:

Couples can set filters based on cuisine, budget, dietary preferences, or distance. They can also prioritize ambiance, such as romantic settings or outdoor dining.
Allows customization so each partner can choose preferences like their favorite cuisine or what they’re in the mood for that night.

### Surprise Me Mode:

If the couple is feeling adventurous, they can activate “Surprise Me” mode where the app randomly selects a restaurant both haven’t swiped on yet.

### Date Night Themes:

The app can suggest themed restaurants (e.g., "Italian Night" or "Sushi Date"), allowing couples to experience different vibes or cuisines.
These can be tied to special events or mood prompts like "cozy dinner" or "adventure date."
